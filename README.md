# Summary

The repository consists of 2 notebooks and a pdf. The notebooks show predictions and a time series forecasting for covid-19 cases and deaths in the US states, along with some Exploratory data analysis and interesting correlation findings. The pdf (named Covid-19 UW Datathon (1).pdf) has a much more detailed outline of visualizations and summarizes the methodology, workflow, and results, as well as a forecast of the covid deaths trajectory for the next 30 days.

# Goal

The goal was to predict how the trajectory of covid deaths would be over the next 30 days. So, I trained an ensemble time series model with an LSTM and ARIMA to do so.

# Data 
The data used is labelled as us-states.csv in the epository. It was obtained from the following Github repository: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-states.csv
